    <h1>April 22nd: </h1>
    <p>
    The very next day, after I ate my lunch I took my bike and went to the school to see if I can fix that tiny issue, so
    I go and meet with the teacher, he calls up the principal he tells him what happened, the principal was a bit confused
    upon hearing that, he checked one of the computers, and VSCode did not launch as described so he told us to try and fix this
    before 7PM because students will come to study so they would use the computers and we would be in the way if we take too long. <br>
    So we both started working on it to see why it did that, teacher did the very classic solution of reinstalling it to see if it's maybe
    it was a corrupted installation issue, it wasn't and obviously doing so wouldn't do anything, so I tried to launch it with the console to see
    if the console spits out any valuable information, so first I launched it and it was fine then I launched it (the desktop shortcut) 
    with console it didn't return anything unfortunately so what I decided to do is track down where the actual binary is at and launch with console
    instead.<br>
    if I recall correctly the errors that showed up after trying launching the binary with and without sudo led me to believe that it's a permission issue
    as I mentioned earlier that yesterday, the console said that cant launch the app without sandboxing without permission so I used the sandbox flag, still nothing
    so I theorized that something in this folder does not have the necessary permissions so I started experimenting with the files inside, after trying multiple files
    with no avail it turns out that the "chrome_crashpad_handler" was the culprit so basically after chmod +x that file, the app is now launching just fine, even after restarts.<br>
    this was a success so I called up the teacher whom called up the principal, so when the principal arrived we let them know about the good news, he was happy to hear that
    so he just tell us to finish installing the OS on the remaining computers with VSCode quick before the students come, I had 2 classes with one having like 5 computers left 
    and there is one more class left and I only had an hour or so left so time was of the essence so I started going really fast installing, 
    updating and also installing that custom VSCode, by the end of it, I managed to install Mint and fully setup on all computers in the class and 8 computers on the other class, with
    12 computers remaining, students starting coming in I decided to stop as I will just be in the way if I continued, principal came in and annonced that the computers will migrate to Linux
    the ones with Linux computers were confused at first but realized that its just like windows so they started using it normally, I was a bit satisfied with my work for today, so I decided
    to call it quit for today and continue my work tomorrow.
