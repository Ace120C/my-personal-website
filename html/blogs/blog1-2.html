    <h1>April 19th: </h1>
    <p>
      I Couldn't attend the school in time because I had a job interview, Long story short, after I was done with it,
      there was still time left to attend my programming school still (like an hour a half), which is still ample time
      to catch up with whatever the teacher have explained to the class already, so I took a taxi, so it's safe to say 
      that I didn't have my laptop with me that day.<br>
      being late to my school was a first because I love programming, I do it even when I'm not in school, so I did explain
      to the teacher why I'm late this time around, anyways apparently today she had given out a team school project where
      we all gonna have to create a website of our choosing with 2 other classmates, everyone started already working on
      it appeared, apparently 2 of my friends already picked me to be with them while I was gone, they asked me what stack
      are we gonna choose since we are apparently gonna make a simple book store front, being a guy who is really into
      the KISS principle (Keep It Simple Stupid), I suggested with just do basic HTML and CSS, and only use like PHP
      if we needed it for scripting something complicated, that should make our site fast enough, and bloat free.<br>
      And of course I elected to not use Javascript because that would just slow the site down, and a simple static
      website does not need Javascript, anyways after finishing designing the website on Figma quickly, we got to work
      so I had to use one of the school computers to do it, I picked a laptop (HP Probook with a 2nd gen i7), already
      booted and appeared to be only was in sleep mode, anyways that laptop had windows 10 on it, and like 4GB of RAM,
      under normal circumstances I usually just code in Neovim, because I'm very used to it at this point and I'm already
      past time the period where I use IDEs for anything, but that laptop has VSCode pre-installed, and time was of the essence
      and we Couldn't afford to waste even more time since we were late already, so I opened VScode and it ages for it to open up.<br>
      after to what seemed to be ages, I got to work to on the website, while my classmate made the git repo, I started making a
      simple server that serves HTML files using Go, because it's so easy to set it up (only around 19 lines), so I coded that quickly,
      and I got into the html file then suddenly laptop fans started spinning, I thought it was odd, considering I wasn't doing anything
      intensive on it yet, and I know VSCode is heavy but not that heavy I thought, while that didn't bother me as much what came next did
      the git repo was finished, and I also finished a sample index page so we could work on it later if we didn't have time to finish it,
      this laptop did not have git on it, I thought that was simple enough, I should just install git, link it with the git repo in couple
      of commands and bob's your uncle right? well windows had other plans, so after getting git and installing it on the laptop, I tried
      typing a git command but VScode did not recognize it, I thought "huh that's weird", I go to Powershell, nothing, Cmd, nothing, but
      git was installed why did windows not installed it properly? I mean git bash was working properly, Long story short we spent the
      remaining time trying to troubleshoot that, other PCs were taken so I couldn't really try another computer for this, we decided
      to finish this project at home because of this. <br>
      After class I went and talked to the school's secretary about how the computers were unreliable with windows and we wasted so much
      time trying to troubleshoot something that shouldn't have happened, and I suggested her that I want Linux in 3 of the computers 
      One for myself, and 2 for my friends so we can work faster next time and deal with windows annoying problems.<br>
      her response was simply "Linux is too hard and you guys aren't the only ones who use those PCs, children only attend this school
      and they will not be able to work with Linux, it's why we have windows, windows is easy for them", I mean fair enough, that would be
      a bit selfish to force a hard OS on children but Linux have came a long way, and there are plenty of distros that do cater to newbies
      so that gave me an idea, I said to her "well I understand that, however Linux isn't and will not be hard at all, if all you want is a familiar
      interface to people that come here, just allow me to install mint, it looks exactly the same as windows", and I showed her a picture of it.<br>
      she was surprised I must say, she paused for a second but then she asked me to just suggest this to the principal because she has no power when
      it comes to the school's equipment, Fair enough, I'll just ask him on Monday, since today was Saturday, and I was mentally drained that time.<br>
