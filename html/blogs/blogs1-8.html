    <h1>Aftermath: </h1>
    <p>
    I had Class this Saturday and I was waiting for my classmates reactions for the new computers makeover
    one of my mates, came in early to school and he was surprised to see that Mint was running on a PC and
    he asked "did you do this? ", for context he knows that I'm a Linux nut and he saw my laptop running Linux
    for as long as I was in here, because I brought my laptop all the time so he kinda knew, he liked Linux
    because he experienced it first hand on my laptop, so he was happy about that, my other classmate came
    he saw Linux and was surprised but after he tried it he liked how smooth it is, he said it's so much better
    than the windows systems they were on these PCs, then the rest came and pretty much had no reactions,
    so I can't tell if they like it or not, Our actual teacher came in, and it seems like she was aware of computers
    running Linux now so class proceeded as normal, but overall it seems like it is a positive result.<br>
    <br>
    I also forgot to mention is that day I found this on one of the computers before everyone even came:
    <img src="../../img/roblox.jpg" alt="roblox">
    somebody tried installing Roblox the windows way in class failed to do so, gave up, and threw the exe into the
    the trash, I found that very funny, and I did let the principal know about that and he found that funny too.<br>
    I have to say this Linux experiment was a success.
