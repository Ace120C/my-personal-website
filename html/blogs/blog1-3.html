    <h1>April 21st: Part 1</h1>
    <p>
    The Plan was simple, it's to get the principal's approval to get 3 assigned computers that I can put Linux on,
    I thought maybe If I explain myself properly, I could get the principal to be on board, I mean it's just 3 PCs right?
    What could go wrong, besides them just saying no?<br>
    <br>
    While I was doing some errands, I decided to stop by the school hoping I'll find the principal, I didn't but I just told the
    secretary to call him to have a chat with me, which made me a bit nervous, "I'm really being an annoyance?", and similar
    questions rushing into my mind at that time, after couple minutes which felt like forever, he came and after greeting him 
    we went to his office to discuss the issue, I explained what's going on and why I want Linux on an assigned computer,
    he did say the same thing as the secretary before and he added that he had Linux before to stop students from playing games in class
    He also added that he is tired from younger students playing games in the middle of class and he asked me "Does Minecraft run on Linux?"
    I said unless you know how to use wine or lutris, the answer is no.<br>
    he considered it for a second and then he added, "we used ubuntu before and teachers complained about it because they didn't know how to use it
    are gonna use ubuntu?", I replied with no, we gonna use Linux Mint, which is based on ubuntu but looks very close to windows, the kids and everyone
    else of all ages will be able operate with it just fine and I showed him a picture of it on the Cinnamon desktop.<br>
    He scanned the picture for a bit and then he said "do you have it on you right now?", I said yes you wanna try it?, he nodded and said "let's do it". <br>
    we picked a random desktop PC from the nearby classroom, and booted into the live image of Mint and handed him the desktop and offered him to try it out,
    which he did, he was impressed with it how snappy it is running from a flashdrive and how familiar it looked, and then he said: 
    "this is good but some important apps for the school did not work when we had Linux and it's why we reverted to windows in the first place", 
    I "said what's the app?" he replied with "VSCode, but not the regular VSCode, we have custom plugins on top of it".<br>
    So turns out the school uses VSCode with some proprietary plugins that are not available on the regular VSCode extension store.<br>
    I said "want me to install it on this computer so we can try it?", he replied "I mean you told me about the problem, then suggested the solution, so yes
    let's do it", I thought that was cool of him to say that, anyways we ended up installing Mint on that computer, he called another teacher, to fetch
    the custom VSCode for Linux, they apparently had made a Linux version of that custom VSCode ages ago but they never bothered with it since and just used 
    the windows version ever since, anyways after I got handed over the flashdrive with that custom VSCode it turned out to be a bash script file, so installing
    it was easy enough, then teacher came in saw that the PC was working flawlessly and with the custom VSCode, he was happy and he told me to install Mint on
    Half the school's computers, basically there were 3 classes in the school, because it is rather small, one for webdev, the other is for python devolopment,
    and the last one was for Game devolopment (Unity/C#/Lua with Roblox Studio), I get to install Linux on the Python Class and the webdev class (which I'm in).<br>
