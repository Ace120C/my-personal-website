    <h1>Introduction: </h1>
    <p>
    I'm a student in a programming school, that happened to be into UNIX based systems, at the time of writing this I have been using Linux for 5 years,
    Our school has a fleet of computers running 2 versions of windows, windows 8 and windows 10 (being 2 or 3 PCs if i recall correctly).<br>
    So, since February, I have been just bringing my laptop to class since it has my favorite OS, on it and I can't stand windows, especially on old hardware
    Our the average computer here has i5-4570, 8GB RAM, no GPU so it only runs with the onboard graphics solution, and our fastest computers has i7-4790 
    with the same 8GB of RAM, and no GPU as well, some had SSDs some did not, it all depends on your luck, however, for the longest time this was not an issue
    for me, since I didn't have to deal with em and my laptop, wasn't that much of a hassle to bring with, even with cycling to school for 2-ish kilometers 
    That being said, this will change in April, which what I will talk about right now.</p>
